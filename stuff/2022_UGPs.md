UGs willing to do projects with me (UGP or otherwise) can apply for the following projects. Send me an email with the heading "[UG Project Appl] \<Project Name\>".

<!-- ## Automatic Speech Recognition
Needs knowledge of machine learning and time series models taught in EE603A (MLSP). -->

## Audio Analysis on Android
Needs knowledge of Android application development. **Open for all, including junior undergrads**. Music knowledge is a plus. **Remote work** possible.

## Models for Music Teaching
Involves working with our music teacher(s) to study learning behavior of students, and to make computational models of the same. You need to be **on campus** for this project.

## Time Series Analysis for Air Quality Sensors
Building ML models for regression. Relevant papers:
