## Registration Note: 
- It is a PG-only course open to all EE PGs only.

## Course Objectives:
Good programming skills are indispensable for good computational research.
The knowledge of data structures and algorithms is necessary for writing efficient and easy to understand codes. 
This course is tailored specifically for EE PGs with limited programming experience. We will use Python to implement the concepts we learn in this course. (Python is one of the most popular high-level languages highly recommended for researchers).
There will be theory classes as well as coding assignments.

## Pre-requisites:
- None
