## Registration Note: 
- I am planning to have around 50 UGs and rest all PGs -- from EE. 
- No limit on the number of PGs.
- For UGs:
  - First come first serve.
  - Anyone who has done no other ML course will be given preference; please write in the remarks "No other ML course".

## Course Objectives:
This course aims at introducing the students to
advanced topics in machine learning (ML). 
The course will begin with lessons on programming
that is needed to enable one to efficiently implement ML
algorithms.
The lectures will focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based assignments for implementation. 

## Registration: (Updated on 23 Nov, 10AM)

- No more space for UG students. But I am accepting all students who have done or are doing projects with me.
- All PG students will be accepted and are encouraged to apply.
- For auditing the course, please send a request to rashmiy@iitk.ac.in.

## Pre-requisites:
- Basic course on machine learning (EE698V or equivalent)
- Digital signal processing (EE301A or equivalent)
- Basics of Programming (ESc101 or equivalent)

The course will need a strong background in linear algebra and probability theory.

## Topics:

- Data structures and Algorithms
- Deep Neural Networks
- Generative Modeling
	- Random sampling (Monte Carlo methods)
	- Variational Auto Encoders
	- Generative Adversarial Networks
	- Normalizing Flows
- Time Series Modeling
	- Dynamic Programming
	- Hidden Markov Models
  - Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs
	- Connectionist Temporal Classification
- Other topics of interest

## References:
  This course will take excerpts from some standard books on machine
  learning and signal processing. But it will largely be based on
  articles and research papers in ML and SP conferences (e.g.,
  NeurIPS, ICML, Interspeech, ICASSP, etc.) and journals (e.g., IEEE
  TASLP, JMLR, IEEE PAMI, etc.).
