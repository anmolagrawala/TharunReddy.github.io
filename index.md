## <span style="color: Green">About me </span>
I received my B.Tech (in 2013), joint M.Tech and Phd degrees (in 2020) in  [<ins>Electrical Engineering</ins>](http://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) from the [<ins>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur</ins>](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), India.My Ph.D. thesis was titled "[<ins>Neural Networks based Optimal Learning and Filtering schemes for EEG Reaction-Time Prediction Brain-Computer Interfaces</ins>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOyRPzQv4ACFscKFfPbERQ-_Db9rF44c/view?usp=sharing)", and my M.Tech thesis  was titled as [<ins> Learning and Divergence based approaches for drowsiness detection</ins>](https://.drivegoogle.com/file/d/1O_e3SM5yiHwZegvkOSqVndaMydc422GP/view?usp=sharing).

| 2020 August- 2021 March: <br> [International BCI Competition winner 2021](http://brain.korea.ac.kr/bci2021/competition.php) :<br>- I served as the **team-leader** of the **only three teams** from India winning in **three** out of **five** tracks of the prestigious International Brain Computer Interface competition 2021 <br>-	1st position in microsleep detection <br>- In this work as part of track-1 event, we try to decode imagined motor movements using few-shot learning <br>-	In this work as part of track-2 event, we try to decode micro-sleep events in drivers using transfer learning <br>-	In this work as part of track-5 event, we try to decode P-300 ERPs during walking <br>- Special emphasis is put on accuracy of decoding and final kappa/ROC curve|

| 2020 Jun -August: <br>**Clinical BCI challenge for Hemi-paretic patients**: <br>- Implemented with Prof. Laxmidhar Behera, Prof. Vipul Arora and group for Clinical BCI challenge 2020, WCCI, Glasgow, UK. Our team **i-BCI ranked no. 2** in the final score-board <br>- In this work, we try to decode imagined motor movements of Hemi-paretic stroke patients <br> Specific contributions are: <br>- Development of non-Euclidean signal processing methods for both cross-subject and within-subject challenges <br>- Special emphasis is put on accuracy of decoding and final kappa score <br/>|
