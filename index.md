## <span style="color: Green">About me:</span>
I received my B.Tech. and PhD Thesis defense in [<ins>Electrical Engineering</ins>](http://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) from the [<ins>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur</ins>](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), India. My Ph.D. thesis was titled "[<ins>Neural Networks based Optimal Learning and Filtering schemes for
EEG Reaction-Time Prediction Brain-Computer Interfaces</ins>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By8wZfM49Y2ScC1vc2lVX0I1c1U/view)", and my Senior M.Tech-Ph.D joint degree where I worked on Learning and Divergence based approaches for drowsiness detection.

| 2020 August- 2021 March: <br> [International BCI Competition winner 2021](http://brain.korea.ac.kr/bci2021/competition.php) :<br>- I served as the **team-leader** of the **only three teams** from India winning in **three** out of **five** tracks of the prestigious International Brain Computer Interface competition 2021 <br>-	1st position in microsleep detection <br>- In this work as part of track-1 event, we try to decode imagined motor movements using few-shot learning <br>-	In this work as part of track-2 event, we try to decode micro-sleep events in drivers using transfer learning <br>-	In this work as part of track-5 event, we try to decode P-300 ERPs during walking <br>- Special emphasis is put on accuracy of decoding and final kappa/ROC curve|
|2020 Jun -August: <br>**Clinical BCI challenge for Hemi-paretic patients**: <br>- Implemented with Prof. Laxmidhar Behera, Prof. Vipul Arora and group for Clinical BCI challenge 2020, WCCI, Glasgow, UK. Our team **i-BCI ranked no. 2** in the final score-board <br>- In this work, we try to decode imagined motor movements of Hemi-paretic stroke patients <br> Specific contributions are: <br>- Development of non-Euclidean signal processing methods for both cross-subject and within-subject challenges <br>- Special emphasis is put on accuracy of decoding and final kappa score |
|June 2017 to 2019 current: <br>**EEG Reaction-Time Prediction Brain Computer Interface**: <br>- Ongoing project with Prof. CT Lin, Prof. Yukai Wang, Prof. Laxmidhar Behera & Prof. Vipul Arora <br>- Implemented deep dual task networks for learning. <br>- The time information is an input in RNN structure EEG has good temporal resolution.In this case, RNN is quite suitable for processing EEG data. We employ RNN to analyze continuous EEG signals for better BCI performance. |
| 2018-2019 current: <br>**Audio based P300 detection Brain Computer Interface**: <br>- Ongoing project with Prof. Laxmidhar Behera & Prof. Vipul Arora <br>- Implemented Riemannian Geometry based features for P300 detection.<br>- Various audio stimuli are probed and P300 waveform is detected with high accuracy and statistical confidence. |
| 2019 Mar: <br>**Build a cost-effective Brain wave controlled wheel-chair**: <br>- Ongoing (initial phase) with Prof.Laxmidhar Behera, IIT Kanpur <br>- A cost-effective brainwave controlled the wheelchair with suitable HMIs forstroke and motor neuron patients will be developed.<br>- Development of a robotic wheelchair with an intelligent interface to be operated using Shared Control strategies. |
| 2016 Jun -2017 Jun: <br>**Dataset collection for Object detection from a group of cluttered images**:<br>- Implemented with Prof. Laxmidhar Behera and group for Amazon picking challenge 2016, Leipzig, Germany <br>- In this work, we try to detect multiple objects in a scene based on data from Kinect 1 sensor, using state of the art Deep Convolutional Neural Network feature extractors.<br> Specific contributions are: <br>- Development of large image annotation database for the problem for both training and testing.<br>- GPU based implementation of Faster Region-CNN network for finding region proposals. |
